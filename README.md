# DockerDash
A docker dashboard for your docker host

## Problem

Docker is a great tool for spinning up services quickly, but it's a
difficult tool for managing those services.

In this tool, I would like to be able to assign ownership of containers
to various users, allow those users to spin up/down containers, allow
those users to delete their own containers without affecting other
containers, and let non-owners see container & image statuses.
